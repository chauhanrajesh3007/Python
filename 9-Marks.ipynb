    "540.You need to create a class called Atm. It should have methods to create the pin, to change the pin, to check balance, to withdraw money, to deposit money. Also, you need to create method called menu to choose from the above given operations which you want to perform. ~create_pin Method:Ask user to enter the pin to create a new pin. Also ask user to initialize the balance of your account. ~change_pin Method:Pin Validation is required before changing the pin. If Pin entered is wrong then message should be displayed “Enter correct pin”. if Pin is correct then update the Old Pin with New Pin. ~check_balance Method:Pin Validation is required for checking the balance. It should display the current balance of account. ~withdraw Method:Pin Validation is required before withdrawing money. It should ask user for amount to withdraw. It should also display the insufficient fund message if withdraw amount is higher than balance else balance should be updated after withdraw. ~deposit Method:Pin Validation is required before deposit of money. It should ask user for amount to deposit. balance should be updated after deposit. After completion of every method it should ask for choice(menu() method) to perform new operation. If you don’t want any operation to perform then you can choose choice of exit to come out from the program"
